Another silly project with physics. Just to have some fun with Octet Framework

This is not a real project, it was me having some fun. If you want to check a real project, I'll suggest having a look at my example_openGEX.
That's a cool project.

I'm writing an importer (from scratch) for this new format, openGEX, to the educational game framework of octet.

Give a look to that project!!
